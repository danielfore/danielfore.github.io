            <h2>Square Points FAQ</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Why is the loyalty club called Square Points?</h3>
                <p>We chose the name Square Points because our thin crust pizza 
                    is sliced in squares as it is in Chicago. This is a style that 
                    is unique to Chicago Fire in this area and is referred to as a “Party Cut”.</p>
            </div>
            <div>

            <div>
            <h3>Do points expire?</h3>
                <p>Yes, if there is a one year lapse in restaurant visits, all 
                    accumulated points expire and any elevated profile statuses 
                    and benefits are lost.</p>
            </div>
            <div>

                <h3>How do I join Square Points?</h3>
                <p>Simple! You just request a Square Points Loyalty card from any

                    least one time, you can then go to our website at Chicagofire.com/Loyalty
