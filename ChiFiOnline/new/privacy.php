            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This statement sets forth the Privacy Policy of West of Chicago Restaurants Inc. DBA Chicago Fire (the “Company”) for the use of the Company’s website (the “website” or “site”), and describes the practices that the Company will follow with respect to the privacy of users of the website.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the Company’s offline information collection activities.  From time to time, we may change this Privacy Policy. For example, as we update and improve our service, new features may require modifications to the Privacy Policy. Accordingly, you should note the date of the latest revision of this Privacy Policy posted at the bottom of this Privacy Policy, which should alert you to changes in this Privacy Policy since your prior visit to this website.
            </p>

                <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> "Personally identifiable information" is information specifically about you that can be used to identify you, such as name, address, e-mail address, a user ID, a driver’s license number or a credit card number.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Information Collection, Use and Distribution:</strong> We want you to understand what private information we collect about you, and how we use your private information. The nature of the services that we provide through our website requires that we collect and use information about you as more fully described below. Some of your private information may be disclosed to third parties (for example, accrediting bodies) in order to provide the information and services that you request, and may be used by both the Company and third parties to provide that information and/or perform those services. In addition, the Company and third parties may use your private information to offer you additional information, products, or services that match your areas of interest.
            We may request that you voluntarily supply us with information, including your e-mail address, street address, telephone number or other information so that we may enhance your site visit, fulfill any orders you may place through our site, or follow up with you after your visit. Whether you provide any information is entirely up to you. 

            If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy.   We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information collected through this site to anyone. Also, the Company may provide aggregate statistics about visitors to our website, such as volume, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifiable information.  the Company may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and enforce our rights or property; (c) enforce the website Terms and Conditions of Use or this Privacy Policy; (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others; (e) resolve disputes, or (f) troubleshoot website problems.

            If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can easily indicate that by checking the appropriate box on the submission form. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Children’s Privacy and Site Age Limitations:</strong> This website is intended for use by persons aged 13 or older, and by your use of this site you affirm that you are at least 13 years of age.  In addition, if you are under the age of 18, you are only permitted to use this website with the consent of your parents or an adult guardian.  The Company will not knowingly allow registration of an account for any person that the Company believes to be younger than 13.  We also do not collect any personally identifiable information from any persons under the age of 13 and if we discover that we have been provided any such information, we will delete this information from our records.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using commercially reasonable and industry standard security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us or through one of our applications. This is especially true for information you transmit via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we use what we believe are commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our servers.

            Internally, we will use reasonable efforts to restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees or contractors who need access to the information to do their jobs. These employees and contractors are required to adhere to our privacy policies. 

            We will review and update our security arrangements and procedures from time to time as we deem appropriate.

                <li><strong>Protecting Your Information:</strong> We recommend that you do not divulge your user password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the website and close your browser window when you have finished visiting our site. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personally identifiable information and correspondence if others have access to your computer.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong> This website, like many other commercial applications and web sites,  utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies are designed to help a web site operator determine that a particular user has visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings of text that web sites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing the website, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site before. 

            We also make use of memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the user of certain the Company website applications. Similarly, if you are a registered user of a site providing service to the Company users (and have a user ID and password), such sites may use cookies to provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using that site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize features of this website if you reject cookies.

                <li><strong>Privacy Policy Changes:</strong> As noted above, we may change our privacy policies from time to time and we may also modify this Privacy Policy.  If we plan to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via the e-mail address that you have provided to us or by other means that are reasonable under the circumstances. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.

                <li><strong>Links to Other Sites:</strong>This website may contain links to other websites. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by, or the content contained on or accessible from, such other websites.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ownership Changes:</strong> In the event that the Company, its business or this website becomes owned or controlled by other individuals or entities, the information we have collected about you through this website or otherwise may be transferred to such other individuals or entities. In such an event, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to the information gathered online about you through this site until you are notified otherwise or a change is made to this Policy and posted or notified as provided above.
